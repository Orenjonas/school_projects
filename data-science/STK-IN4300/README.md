# STK-IN4300 - Statiske l√¶ringsmetoder i Data Science
The course focuses on methods for modern data analysis both within a practical and theoretical framework.

Learning outcome:

- Understand key concepts for a good analysis of the data
- Understand the theoretical aspects of methods within machine/statistical learning
- Know a range of different methods for data analysis, including penalized likelihood and basis expansions, neural networks, boosting and ensemble methods and Gaussian processes within machine learning
- Know procedures for fitting such methods to data, including (stochastic) gradient descent and back-propagation
- Be able to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the methods and choose between them in practice.
