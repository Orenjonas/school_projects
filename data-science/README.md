  classification), and also how to evaluate such methods;
- can master many different methods for supervised learning, including linear
  models, logistic regression, tree-based methods, bootstrapping and other
  simulation-based methods, dimension reduction and regularization, bagging and
  boosting and support vector machines;
- have knowledge on issues connected to high-dimensional data;
- have knowledge of problems connected to large amounts of data and methods for
