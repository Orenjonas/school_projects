Temperature and CO2 plotter
===========================

This is a python script for interactive plotting of CO2 and temperature data on a web server.
The script demonstrates basic usage of flask for building web applications, and
pandas for data visualization.

A lot of error handling is lacking, and the application could use more features.

How to run
==========

Start the server with

``` bash
>>> python3 server.py
```

And open the generated link in a web browser.
